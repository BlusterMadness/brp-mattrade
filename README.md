# brp-mattrade
A materials trading script made by me, Bluster_Madness for my FiveM server BlackLight RP. 
You turn in 100 blue bins (jim-recycle) for 100 or more materials of your choosing. 
You can edit this to trade in anything for anything. Mess around with it and have fun.

## Installation

- unzip the file â†’ brp-mattrade
- Remove **main** from the name
- place it in your server's resource folder

- make sure to add
- ```
  ensure brp-mattrade
  ```
- to your server.cfg
- If you have it in a subfolder like [standalone] no need to ensure it
- restart the server

## Dependencies
- QBcore

## Requirements
- NONE! But I did make this to work with jim-recycle to trade in your blue bins for materials of your choosing.
- You can edit the items you trade and reveive

## Credits
You can do what you want with this script.
Giving me some credit would be nice :)
